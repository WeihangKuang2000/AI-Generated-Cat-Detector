# AI Generated Cat Detector

In this project I will implement some classifiers to predict whether or not images of cats are "deepfakes", i.e., generated by AI. (I used SD 1.5, and down-sampled to match CIFAR-10, which we use for real images.) 

For this implementation we will use the functionality of PyTorch, HuggingFace "transformers" library for getting pretrained models, scikit-learn (for cross validation utility and for baseline logistic regression), matplotlib for visualization.

Use data.pt for the dataset
